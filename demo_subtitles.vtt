00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.259
hello and welcome to our visualization

2
00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.180
demonstration surrounding food

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.460
insecurity in the United States right

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.500
now you're looking at our homepage and

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.660
to see our visualizations you can go to

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.299
the menu in the top left corner and

7
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.660
select map analysis and exploration or

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.119
poverty rate analysis first we'll look

9
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.699
at the map so we've plotted

10
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.560
the food deserts across the United

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.140
States the size of the point is

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.180
dependent on the county population and

13
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.800
the luminance of the point is dependent

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.140
on the County's severity of food

15
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.239
insecurity

16
00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.440
below we look at the relationship

17
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.780
between food insecurity and County

18
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.160
population

19
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.020
food insecurity and the percentage of

20
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.719
the county receiving SNAP benefits and

21
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.640
food insecurity against the percentage

22
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.820
of the county without access to vehicles

23
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.520
if you brush over the map you'll see the

24
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.620
Scatter Plots below change

25
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.379
we have tooltip functionality on the

26
00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.480
Scatter Plots that allows you to see the

27
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
county name state name population and

28
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.159
severity percentage

29
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.740
to reset the selection you can click the

30
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.840
button up here in the top left

31
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.000
and it will update the Scatter Plots

32
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.720
again

33
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.820
for further exploration of the map you

34
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.920
can click map exploration

35
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.140
and you'll see the same map again but

36
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
now you can zoom in and hover for

37
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.140
tool tips to see more information about

38
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.060
the graph

39
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.759
now our last visualization

40
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.000
is the poverty rate analysis here you

41
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.659
can see the relationship between food

42
00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.020
insecurity versus poverty rate and the

43
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
luminance of the points is dependent on

44
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.320
the percentage of the population

45
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.439
receiving SNAP benefits we have the

46
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.200
tooltip functionality again on this

47
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600
graph and we also have the option to

48
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.920
filter for a specific state

49
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.439
thank you so much and we hope you

50
00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740
enjoyed
